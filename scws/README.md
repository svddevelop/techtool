The server is a lightweight script processor for text files with the ability to run shell processes and stream the output to a browser. It can operate as a standalone application or as a service.

### 1. Description of the Main Page and Script Interaction Principle

The main page can be reconfigured to use a different interface, but here we explain how the scripts interact with each other.  
The main page consists of a fixed panel with a menu button and a client area where the results of the executed scripts are displayed.  
The client area is implemented using an `<iframe>` element. The main page contains several JavaScript helper functions.  

When the menu button is clicked, the `loadMenu()` function sends an asynchronous AJAX request to the server. Upon receiving a response, it builds a tree of menu items and displays it to the user.  

When a menu item is selected, JavaScript changes the `src` property of the `contentFrame` (iFrame) element to the value corresponding to the selected menu item. This way, the content of the new request is displayed inside the frame.  

Another helper function is `requestServer(URL)`. It performs an asynchronous request to the server and returns the result. It can be used to add new variables to the server, modify menu items, and perform other actions.  

#### 1.1. Internal Server URLs

##### 1.1.1. `/shell`
Executes a command passed in the `cmd` parameter. Implemented in the `shell.thtml` file.  
Example: `/shell?cmd=python myscript.py`  

##### 1.1.2. `/menulist`
Returns a list of menu items and their commands. By default, they are read from the configuration file, but they can be modified using the `/menu` request sent asynchronously by the `requestServer()` function.  

##### 1.1.3. `/menu`
Allows managing the menu:  
- `/menu?clear` — clears the list;  
- `/menu?default` — restores the list from the configuration file;  
- `/menu?captionX=My caption in menu X&cmdX=my URL` — modifies or adds a menu item with the specified caption and URL.  
All commands can be combined in a single request. They are executed in the order specified in the URL.  

##### 1.1.4. `/envvar`
Adds a new variable and its value for use in templates.  
Example: `/envvar?myvar=My value` — the variable can be referenced in the template as `$(myvar)`.  

##### 1.1.5. `/stop`
Stops listening on the port and terminates the application.  

##### 1.1.6. `/shellresponse`
Returns all unread data from the output stream after executing a command via `/shell`. If no command is running, a 404 error code is returned.  

##### 1.1.7. `/shellrun`
Returns a 200 code if a command was launched via `/shell`. Otherwise, it returns a 404 code.  

### 2. Description of the Configuration File

#### 2.1. `Application` Section

##### 2.1.1. `Port` Parameter
Specifies the port on which the server will listen for requests. The default is 8080. When changing the port, ensure firewall access is configured. For example, using the `ufw` utility:  
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

##### 2.1.2. `RootPath` Parameter
Contains the path to the directory with the templates for requested pages. The default is `/var/techtool/thtml/`, but any other directory can be used for debugging.  

##### 2.1.3. `RootFileName` Parameter
Specifies the name of the template file to be used when the URL `/` is called.  

##### 2.1.4. `WorkDir` Parameter
Contains the path to the folder for temporary files, such as logs. The default is `/tmp`.  

#### 2.2. `MENU[X]` Section
The number in the section name is mandatory and must be unique.  

##### 2.2.1. `MenuCaption` Parameter
Contains the text displayed to the user in the menu.  

##### 2.2.2. `MenuCommand` Parameter
Contains the URL of the page to be called (see URL description).  

### 3. URL Processing

When specifying a script name with or without an extension, the server searches for the file in the path specified in the configuration file (`APPLICATION.RootPath`). If the file is not found, the browser receives a 404 response.  

When a page is requested, the server performs the following substitutions:  

#### 3.1. Configuration Variables
In the script, specify the section name and parameter (without a separator) in uppercase.  
For example: `$(APPLICATIONPORT)`  

#### 3.2. Environment Variables
In the script, specify the variable name with case sensitivity.  
For example: `$(SHELL)`  

#### 3.3. Variables Defined by the Developer During Shell Execution
The conditions are the same as for environment variables.  

### 4. Debugging Scripts with CSWS

This directory contains three pre-compiled versions of the program, designed for different platforms:

- **`aarch64-linux`** — version for Raspberry Pi devices;
- **`x86_64-win64`** — version for 64-bit Windows systems;
- **`x86_64-linux`** — version for 64-bit Linux systems.

Launching the application with a separate configuration file allows for flexible customization of parameters and templates, making it easier to debug scripts. This enables testing their functionality directly in a browser without the need to make changes on the Raspberry Pi device.

#### 4.1. Command Line Parameters

The program supports the following command-line parameters:

- **`--conf="my.conf"`**  
  Launches the program using the specified configuration file. This allows for the use of custom settings and templates.

- **`--stop`**  
  Stops the program if it is already running.

- **`--envvar`**  
  Displays a list of all environment variables available to the program.

- **`--addmenu="<menu caption>:=:<command>"`**  
  Adds a new menu section to the configuration file.  
  - `<menu caption>` — the menu title;  
  - `<command>` — the command associated with this menu item.
