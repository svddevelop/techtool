### Simplified Diagram

Everything is assembled using ready-made modules, so the diagram is greatly simplified.

The diagram shows the connections between the Raspberry Pi connector and the MCP2515+TJA1050 module. The module is powered from the RPI +5V pin. However, the module has a design flaw and requires modification. The power for the TJA1050 should remain +5V, while the MCP2515 requires +3V3. The RPi pinout operates at 3 volts, is tolerant to 5 volts due to internal suppressors, and does not require a level converter.

Therefore, the MCP2515+TJA1050 module has undergone some modifications. The traces on both sides were cut, the contacts were cleaned, and an AS1117-3V3 chip was soldered to step down the voltage from 5 volts to 3 volts.

>**Warning:**
When connecting the circuit to the OBD2 onboard connector, do not forget to include jumper J1 (120Î© terminator).

Since the modules need to be powered from the onboard power supply of the OBD2 connector, the MP1854 was chosen as the STEP-Down regulator, which can operate with an input voltage range of 5 to 36 volts. Additionally, it provides short-circuit protection for a short duration.

Before connecting the regulator to the RPi, it is necessary to set the output voltage using the potentiometer to the range of 5 volts. Simply connect it to the RPi +5V and GND pins. Also, the GND pin must be connected to pin 4 of the OBD2 connector, and the In+ pin of the regulator must be connected to pin 16 of the OBD2 connector.

>**Warning:**
The pin numbering on the connector is shown correctly in the diagram, but in reality, pins 9 to 16 are in reverse order, and pin 16 is located below pin 1.
